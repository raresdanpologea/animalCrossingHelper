Hello! Are you an avid Animal Crossing:New Horizons player that's trying to collect all fish? 
Are you missing only a couple but you don't know when they appear and you don't want to ruin the fun by looking them up?
You're in luck!
This app asks you to tick off the ones you already have on your grid, works out which ones are missing, which ones of those are available right now based on your system's time, and then gives you hints on where to find them!

This was written in Django, and uses the built-in SQLite DB. To run it, import the project, then run "python manage.py runserver".
